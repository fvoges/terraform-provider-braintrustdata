# Tier C: Workflow Architecture

Use these for lifecycle-driven ownership at scale:

- examples/workflows/access-control-lifecycle (recommended)
- examples/workflows/access-control-data-driven (legacy all-in-one)

Goal: manage projects, role-like groups, ACLs, and memberships with explicit ownership boundaries.
