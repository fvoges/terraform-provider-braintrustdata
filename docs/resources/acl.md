# braintrustdata_acl (Resource)

Manages a Braintrust ACL (Access Control List) entry. ACLs grant specific permissions to users, groups, or roles on Braintrust objects.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Grant read permission to a user on a project
resource "braintrustdata_project" "example" {
  name        = "my-project"
  description = "Example project"
}

resource "braintrustdata_acl" "user_read" {
  object_id   = braintrustdata_project.example.id
  object_type = "project"
  user_id     = "user-id-here"
  permission  = "read"
}

# Grant update permission to a group on a dataset
resource "braintrustdata_group" "data_team" {
  name        = "data-team"
  description = "Data science team"
}

resource "braintrustdata_acl" "group_update" {
  object_id   = "dataset-id-here"
  object_type = "dataset"
  group_id    = braintrustdata_group.data_team.id
  permission  = "update"
}

# Grant permission to a role on an organization
resource "braintrustdata_role" "admin" {
  name        = "admin"
  description = "Administrator role"
}

resource "braintrustdata_acl" "role_org_access" {
  object_id   = "org-id-here"
  object_type = "organization"
  role_id     = braintrustdata_role.admin.id
  permission  = "create"
}

# Grant restricted access (only for specific object types)
resource "braintrustdata_acl" "restricted" {
  object_id            = braintrustdata_project.example.id
  object_type          = "project"
  user_id              = "user-id-here"
  permission           = "read"
  restrict_object_type = "experiment"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `object_id` (String) The ID of the object to grant access to (e.g., project ID, dataset ID).
- `object_type` (String) The type of object. Valid values: organization, project, experiment, dataset, prompt, prompt_session, group, role, org_member, project_log, org_project.

### Optional

- `group_id` (String) The ID of the group to grant access to. Exactly one of user_id, group_id, or role_id must be specified.
- `permission` (String) The permission level to grant. Valid values: create, read, update, delete, create_acls, read_acls, update_acls, delete_acls.
- `restrict_object_type` (String) When specified, restricts the ACL to only apply to objects of this type.
- `role_id` (String) The ID of the role to grant access to. Exactly one of user_id, group_id, or role_id must be specified.
- `user_id` (String) The ID of the user to grant access to. Exactly one of user_id, group_id, or role_id must be specified.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) The timestamp when the ACL was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the ACL.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# ACLs can be imported using their ID
terraform import braintrustdata_acl.example acl-123456789
```
